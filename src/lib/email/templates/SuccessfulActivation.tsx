            <Paragraph>
              Please note that as we are currently in beta, there is a Google
              OAuth limitation that requires you to re-grant authorization every
              7 days. The app will send a reminder email a couple of days before
              the expiry, so this is just a heads-up! You can always revoke the
              authorization via your Google account settings at any time.
